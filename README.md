<h1>Teck Stack :</h1>

 <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>BootStrap</li>
  <li>LocalStorage</li>
  <li>Mock Servers</li>

we have used JavaScript code to convert the currency of one country to another country. To use this service, we designed our own database and created our own mock-servers and used own API's, like 1) https://nearsteeluserdata.onrender.com/ and 2)https://mm-money-mingle.onrender.com/country_data. We will use these API's to get the live conversion rates and convert the corresponding amount.

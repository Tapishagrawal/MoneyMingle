MoneyMingle is a financial application that helps users quickly convert their Money to other currencies. 

### The Goal:
The goal of MoneyMingle is to provide a convenient and user-friendly platform for currency conversion .We are working on this project to make these transactions faster, more affordable, and more transparent for users.

### Design Process:
To help us prioritize and understand the user's needs, and challenges, We designed Feedback form which will help us every time to go through user expectations and needs regarding this website.

We also learnt on designing with users feedback insteaad of assumption and it increased our work progress.

<h1>Teck Stack :</h1>

 <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>LocalStorage</li>
  <li>Mock Servers</li>

we have used JavaScript code to convert the currency of one country to another country. To use this service, we designed our own database and created our own mock-servers and used own API's, like 1) https://nearsteeluserdata.onrender.com/ and 2)https://mm-money-mingle.onrender.com/country_data. We will use these API's to get the live conversion rates and convert the corresponding amount.
